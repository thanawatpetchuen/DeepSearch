<font face="Times"><font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">n the fifties, Marshall
McLuhan of the University of Toronto alerted the world that media are not
passive conduits of information but deeply affect the human mind. He made
a compelling case that "the medium is the message" by demonstrating that
writing and oral communication required, and therefore instigated, the
creation of different cognitive skills (McLuhan 1962. 27-39; 1964. 81-90;
Moos 1997). Following in McLuhanís footsteps, I argue that the token system,
a Neolithic medium of communication, provoked profound cognitive changes
(Schmandt-Besserat 1992.1996)</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="Times"><font size="+2">I. The Token System: A Neolithic
Medium Of Communication</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Times"><font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">okens are recovered
in Middle Eastern archaeological sites dating 8000-3000 BC, from Syria
to Persia and from Anatolia to Palestine as well as in parts of Eurasia
ca 5000-4000 BC (Budja 1998). These clay artifacts, about 1-2 cm across,
are modeled in multiple shapes. Some have geometric forms such as cones,
spheres, disks, cylinders, tetrahedrons, ovoids, triangles and quadrangles
(<a href="fig1.jpg">Fig.1</a>). Others take naturalistic shapes such as
miniature animal heads, vessels, tools and furniture (<a href="fig2.jpg">Fig.
2</a>). Many bear markings in the form of incised lines (Schmandt-Besserat
1996. 15-20) (<a href="fig3.jpg">Fig.3</a>).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Tokens were counters used to keep track
of goods with each token form standing for one specific unit of a commodity.
For example, a cone and a sphere represented respectively a small and a
large measure of grain (Fig. 1) and a disk with an incised cross, a sheep
(Fig. 3). The number of units of merchandise was shown in one-to-one correspondence.
In other words, two small units of grain were shown with two cones, three
cones stood for three small units of grain, and so on. It is now well established
that, in the fourth millennium BC, the tokens were an accounting device
used by the Mesopotamian temple administration to record entries or expenditures
of goods offered by worshippers during monthly religious festivals. Presumably,
their function was similar in prehistory, when they served to collect and
administer communal goods and, as such, were the backbone of a redistribution
economy (Schmandt-Besserat 1992. 170-183).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The token system was a medium of communication.
(Schmandt-Besserat 1992. 161-165). Each counter can be termed an "ideogram"
or sign standing for a concept ó a unit of merchandise. There was moreover
not only one type of token carrying a discrete meaning but an entire repertory
of interrelated types of tokens, each with a corresponding discrete meaning.
The tokens, therefore, represent the earliest non-verbal code, or sign
system for transmitting economic information. The token system is furthermore
the immediate forerunner of the first writing system, the Mesopotamian
cuneiform script. The transition from counters to script occurred about
3300 BC when tokens, probably representing a debt, were stored in an envelope
until payment. These envelopes in the shape of a hollow clay ball hid the
tokens held inside. The accountants, therefore, impressed the tokens on
the surface of the envelope before enclosing them, so that the shape and
number of counters could be checked at all times without breaking the envelope
(<a href="fig4.jpg">Fig. 4</a>). The cones and spheres, representing measures
of grain, for example, appeared respectively as wedge-shaped and circular
impressed markings. About 3200 BC, once the system of impressed signs was
understood, clay tablets - solid cushion-shaped clay artifacts bearing
the impressions of tokens - replaced the token-filled envelopes (<a href="fig5.jpg">Fig.
5</a>). At that point, the three-dimensional tokens had been replaced by
two-dimensional impressed signs, that conveyed the same meaning.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">For the first three to five hundred
years, writing continued in the wake of tokens. It is only about 2700 BC
that, finally, the cuneiform script broke away from its forerunner to emulate
spoken language. Writing borrowed the syntax of speech and, as a result,
texts were no longer restricted to itemizing goods but opened to various
fields of human experience. Progressively it became phonetic (Roch Lecours
1995. 219). Logograms, referring to the sound of monosyllabic words, gave
way to syllabograms representing fragments of words. Finally, after the
invention of the alphabet, about 1500 BC, letters reached the ultimate
segmentation of sound (Tzeng, Hung1981. 237).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The tokens were not a marginal or esoteric
medium. On the contrary, the considerable number of counters and their
widespread distribution within settlements prove that, during no less than
five millennia, the clay tokens were household items for keeping track
of everyday mundane commodities, and in particular, of dues to the collectivity.
Their pervasiveness in all parts of the Middle East and their spread into
Eurasia is good evidence of their importance in pre- and proto-history.
Finally, they played a crucial role in the evolution of communication (Vygotsky
1978. 46). The fact that the token system was the first code to supplement
speech and that it is the immediate precursor of western writing makes
it an important medium to be reckoned with.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="Times"><font size="+2">II. Tokens and Neolithic Media</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Times"><font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he token system
originated in the Neolithic period, about 5000 years before civilization,
and in particular, before the invention of writing. The tokens, therefore,
were the creation of an oral world, when information was exchanged face
to face, by word of mouth. In this part of the paper, I compare and contrast
the tokens to the spoken word.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Both tokens and words were symbols.
Tokens were artifacts and words were strings of sounds that stood for something
else. That is to say, words and tokens were "signifiants" standing for
a "signifi&eacute;" (Baron 1981. 168-169). As symbols, spoken words have
semantic values (Goldwasser 1995. 27). A word, such as "sheep," refers
to a single, discrete, unequivocal entity, here a ruminant mammal of genus
Ovis. Likewise each token shape was endowed with a single, discrete, unequivocal
meaning. For instance, a disk incised with a cross meant "sheep". Whenever
repeated, the disk with a cross always referred to the same item, "sheep,"
and only to that item.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Because they were symbols, the form
of a token is arbitrary, much as the sound of words are arbitrary (White
1949. 25-30). There was no fundamental reason why the disk bearing a cross
meant "sheep." Similarly, there is no fundamental reason why the assembled
sounds "sh-ee-p" refer to a ruminant mammal of genus Ovis. In fact, any
other shape or sound would do, as long as it was adopted by a society.
The naturalistic tokens were similarly arbitrary. For instance "dog" signified
by a dogís head (<a href="fig3.jpg">Fig. 3</a>) was an arbitrary choice
since the animal "dog" could be represented, just as well, by a dogís tail
or the representation of the entire animal.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Tokens, like words, were part of comprehensive,
integrated systems. In other words, just as each society has enough words
to communicate all useful items: the Inuits have words to describe all
possible snow conditions and Arabic has a vocabulary to denote all varieties
of camel hair, so there were as many token forms as there were goods to
administer. The assemblage of tokens from Tepe Asiab, an early agricultural
community ca. 7500 BC in western Iran, yielded multiple subtypes of tokens
(sixteen) standing for products of the farm. But the token repertory grew
in time because, like spoken language, the system was open. That is to
say, when the inventory of merchandize expanded, so did the number of token
types. For instance, in the fourth millennium BC, in the Sumerian city
of Uruk, the token repertory reached 250 shapes to represent products manufactured
in the urban workshops, which included textiles, garments, jewelry, perfume,
vessels, furniture and tools.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The token system and spoken language,
however, shared only fundamental features of symbolism. Needless to say,
the tokens were a rudimentary medium compared to spoken words. Unlike speech,
they were restricted to one type of information only, namely, real goods.
Furthermore, the counters were "ideograms" standing exclusively for noun
concepts. The system had no symbols for verbs, pronouns, articles or prepositions.
Unlike spoken language, the token system made no use of syntax. That is
to say, the meaning of a token was independent of its placement order.
" Jane likes Bob" has a meaning different from "Bob likes Jane," but three
cones and three spheres arranged in any possible way, were always to be
translated "three small and three large baskets of grain." Furthermore,
the token system had no way to express numerosity other than in one-to-one
correspondence, i.e., by matching the number of counters to the number
of units counted (Justus 1996). Most importantly, the fact that the same
token shapes were used in a large area of the Near East, where many dialects
would have been spoken, shows that a same type of counter always referred
to the same goods even though the words for these goods differed. In other
words, the tokens were truly ideograms, not logograms, corresponding to
language specific words. Unlike spoken language, the counters were not
based on phonetics.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">It may be added here that the token
system also differed from the rare manifestations of Neolithic symbolic
art. The overriding function of art is to stimulate or express emotions
rather than communicating concrete information (Scheffler 1997. 112). Therefore,
although the tokens and art were two visual media, they greatly differed
in contents. Whereas the counters conveyed specific economic data, statues,
figurines, amulets, wall paintings or plastered skulls dealt with intangibles
(Cauvin 1997). Whereas the images probably evoked nebulous supernatural
religious or magical powers, the tokens referred to precise units of a
specific daily life commodity. Finally, whereas the meaning of some of
the counters can be traced through the cuneiform signs that replaced them,
the significance of Neolithic images will always remain enigmatic and,
therefore, art is beyond the scope of this paper.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The tokens constituted an original
medium of communication to collect, process, store, and retrieve information.
The system of counters differed fundamentally from other Neolithic symbolic
media such as art and spoken language. Namely, they differed from art in
contents and from the spoken word in form.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="Times"><font size="+2">III. Tokens: The New Cognitive Skills</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Times"><font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he tokens were
a radical departure from oral communication because they relied on a different
sensory mode: words were aural and tokens were visual. In the following
part of this paper, I discuss how, as McLuhan would have predicted it,
shifting communication from the ear to the eye had irrevocable cognitive
consequences.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The first notable outcome of a visual
communication system was abstracting knowledge from knower. Aural information
was stored in individualsí brains, requiring willingness and certain physiological
conditions in order to be retrieved. But tokens were extra-somatic. As
a result, information stored by tokens could be decoded at all times by
anyone initiated in the system (Olson 1980. 3).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The tokens transmitted bare data. For
example, three cones stated "3 small measures of grain" in the most concise,
explicit and unambiguous manner. This differed from oral information which,
in order to facilitate memorization, was often couched in a flowery style,
in narratives, allegories or metaphors and used rhythmic devices, such
as repetition and alliteration (Ong 1982. 37-41). Tokens abstracted data
from verbal context (Goody 1977. 88).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">There are more than 50 ways to say
"to-night," because, as described by McLuhan (1964. 82), oral communication
is "hot," involving gestures, facial expressions, intonation and inflexion.
But the tokens were "cold" because they abstracted data from body language.
A cone was a cone and its significance, namely, a small measure of grain,
never varied.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Moreover, oral communication, also
in McLuhanís word, was "vibrant" because it was meant for and tuned to
an audience, constantly adjusting to its reactions. In contrast, the tokens
were "static." Whatever the circumstances, the value of the cone, or any
other token, remained unchanged. Tokens abstracted data from subjectivity.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The shift from ear to eye was of great
importance because it made it possible for individuals to touch and visualize
information. In other words, tokens prompted new cognitive skills to manipulate,
scan, evaluate, scrutinize and analyze an account. This in turn, allowed
new ways of abstracting data.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Whereas words consist of immaterial
sounds, the tokens were concrete, solid, tangible artifacts, which could
be handled, arranged and rearranged at will. For instance, the tokens could
be ordered in special columns according to types of merchandise, entries
and expenditures; donors or recipients. The token system thus encouraged
manipulating data by abstracting all possible variables. (Harth 1983. 19)</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">No doubt patterning, the presentation
of data in a particular configuration, was developed to highlight special
items (Luria 1976. 20). For instance, organizing units of a same kind in
lines became possible with tokens. Furthermore, these lines, as is illustrated
by the signs impressed on envelopes and tablets, were organized hierarchically,
the units of greater value being placed above the lesser ones. For instance,
spheres, standing for large measures of grain were systematically lined
up above the cones, representing small measures of grain (<a href="fig5.jpg">Fig.
5</a>). The token system provided strategies to abstract the relative value
of merchandise.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Tokens facilitated counting. They made
it easy to add, subtract, multiply and divide by manually moving and removing
counters. The geometric lay out of operations such as adding two tokens
to two tokens, and three tokens to three tokens, and so on, helped the
conceptualization of abstract numbers. (Justus 1999. 56, 64. Hoyrup 1994.
70)</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Whereas words can only be uttered one
at a time, groups of any number of tokens could be handled at the same
time. This made possible to deal simultaneously with the multiple components
of a comprehensive budget. The system stretched human cognition to cope
with new levels of complexity.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Compared to the spoken word that fades
instantly, the single most important advantage of solid tokens was permanence.
The artifacts could be stored for any length of time. For example, the
record of a debt could be kept until it was repaid. The tokens were mnemonic:
they liberated memory.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">Finally, because the tokens provided
the physical proof of an agreement and because they were small, light and
sturdy, the counters could be transported to conduct transactions in the
absence of a party involved. Communication over distance expanded the sphere
and scope of human interaction.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">In sum, the substitution of tokens
for real goods introduced multiple new ways of handling data in abstraction
(van Gigch 1991. 234). A word like "sheep" and the corresponding token,
a disk bearing a cross, abstracted data from their context in a similar
way: the sheep could be accounted for orally, in a conversation, or visually,
on the accountantís table, independently of the status or location of the
animals. But tokens further abstracted information from any human source
and from verbal and body language. As a result, the Neolithic accountant
was no longer the passive recipient of someone elseís knowledge, but took
an active part in decoding the visual information encoded in the counters.
This necessitated the acquisition of new cognitive skills that capitalized
upon the visualization and physical manipulation of data. In turn, these
new techniques fostered further abstraction of the data according to such
variables as type of goods, value and number. As a result, the Neolithic
society was able to handle larger amounts of more complex information with
greater efficiency and objectivity. Finally, tokens removed data from the
contingency of place and time and, by doing so, they expanded the sphere
of human interaction and liberated human memory from tedious lists of data,
difficult to memorize.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="Times"><font size="+2">Conclusion</font></font></b>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he Paleolithic
medium of communication was speech. Spoken language is the natural, universal
form of human communication that mankind has the inborn ability to acquire.
As McLuhan eloquently argued (1964: 83), the directness, freshness and
subtleness of a face to face transaction, which combines voice intonations
with facial expressions and body-language has never been surpassed.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The Neolithic farmers of the Middle
East invented a system of clay tokens to count and account for units of
goods. As McLuhan would have predicted it, the switch to a radically different
medium, based on visual and tangible artifacts, spurred significant cognitive
changes. The major outcome was to increase the human capacity for dealing
with actual things in abstraction.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times"><font size="+1">The token system set media on a visual
course that incessantly challenged the human mind to deal with the real
world in greater abstraction. In short, tokens paved the way for writing
to translate aural communication into a visual form and the two-dimensional
written signs were further removed from the goods represented than the
previous three-dimensional tokens. Then, phonetic signs no longer represented
commodities, but the sounds of the corresponding words. Ultimately, the
alphabet with semantically meaningless letters standing for semantically
meaningless sounds created yet another double level of abstraction (McLuhan
1964. 86). Now, writing in electronic form further removes humans from
the real world. McLuhan referred to the effect of media on the human mind
as powerful vortices. The metaphor certainly suits the token effect.</font></font>
