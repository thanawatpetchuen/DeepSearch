Please see here for exceptions.Springer Nature encourages the authors of all original research papers to self-archive the final author version (author's accepted version of their manuscript), with a release date of 6 months post-publication. To facilitate self-archiving, Springer Nature deposits manuscripts in PubMed Central and Europe PubMed Central on behalf of authors who opt in to this free service during submission. (This service does not apply to Reviews.) Springer Nature operates under exclusive license to publish agreements with its research authors. Authors retain copyright of their original research papers.
